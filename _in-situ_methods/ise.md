## Short method description

Two or more electrodes are inserted into the soil to a specific depth.
A voltage is applied across the electrodes.
The resistance or conductivity of the soil to the current is measured.
This measurement of electrical conductivity (EC) is used to estimate the total dissolved salts, which is a measure of soil salinity.
