Soil spectroscopy is progressively becoming a mature method for determining soil properties. Spectroscopy can not determine all properties that are traditioally analysed using wet laboratory methods, but many key attributes are today routinely determined by spectroscopy also in commercial soil laboratories.

## Short method description

### FOSS instrument

The ladoratury FOSS DS spectrometer can report the spectra as aborbance or diffuse reflectamce. In the AI4SH all spectral data is stored as diffuse reflectance values. The conversion from absorbance to reflectance is integrated into the [Data management package][management_package].
