    <h1 id="artificial-intelligence-for-soil-health-ai4sh---in-situ-data">Artificial Intelligence for Soil Health (AI4SH) - In-situ data</h1>

<p>The <a href="https://mission-soil-platform.ec.europa.eu">EU Soil Mission</a> supported project [AI4SoilHealth][AI4SH] includes a component (“work-package”) on in-situ soil sampling. In total 13 different methods were tested for in-situ data sampling and analysis. Links to the different methods are available in the left panel and under the short description of each method on this page.</p>

<h2 id="sample-sites">Sample sites</h2>

<p>The AI4SH test, or pilot, sites cover many of Europe’s agroecological and climate zones and include the following countries:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Croatia,</li>
  <li>Denmark,</li>
  <li>England,</li>
  <li>Finland,</li>
  <li>France,</li>
  <li>(Germany),</li>
  <li>Greece,</li>
  <li>(Italy),</li>
  <li>Netherlands,</li>
  <li>Spain,</li>
  <li>Sweden,</li>
  <li>Switzerland, and</li>
  <li>Wales.</li>
</ul>

<p>The pilot sites in Germany and Italy did no include any in-situ data sampling and are thus not covered in this documentation.</p>

<h2 id="in-situ-methods-applied">In-situ methods applied</h2>

<p>The methods applied for the in-situ data collection within AI4SH can broadly be divided into 3 categories:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Professional laboratory methods,</li>
  <li>Citizen scientist methods, and</li>
  <li>Direct layperson methods.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="professional-laboratory-methods">Professional laboratory methods</h3>

<p>For all in-situ sites traditional, or “wet”, chemicophysical laboratory methods were used as a reference frame for evaluating the suite of alternative and novel methods tested. Most of the collected samples were analysed at the same laboratory, applying the same method for all samples. Only the initial test-sampling at the Greece site Ktima-Gerovassiliou, was not analysed using the same laboratory.</p>

<p>Details on the wet laboratory methods and links to the source data are found on the <a href="/in-situ_methods/wetlab/">wet laboratory</a> page.</p>

<h3 id="environmental-dna-edna">environmental DNA (eDNA)</h3>

<p>Environmental DNA (eDNA) is revolutionising the study of the soil microcosm, both the (groups of) species that exists, and the functions they perform. In soil, eDNA originate mainly from prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea), fungi, protists, plants and animals. The composition of DNA offers a snapshot of ecosystem diversity, function and health. The focus of the eDNA studies in AI4SH is on prokaryotes and fungi.</p>

<p>Details on the eDNA methods and links to the source data are found on the <a href="/in-situ_methods/edna/">eDNA</a> page.</p>

<h3 id="laboratory-spectroscopy">Laboratory spectroscopy</h3>

<p>Spectroscopy, the study of how electromagnetic radiation interacts with matter, is available not only as a laboratory method; it can also be used by citizen scientists and even as a direct layperson method. In AI4Sh all three levels where tested.</p>

<p>Laboratory spectrometry covers a larger spectral range, bridging from visible (VIS) via near infra-red (NIR) to mid-infrared (MIR) regions. Laboratory spectrometers also have higher spectral resolution and better precision. All samples collected within AI4SH were analysed with a a laboratory spectrometer at 0.5 nano-meter (nm) spectral resolution and covering the range 400 - 2500 nm (full VIS-NIR range). Soil attributes that can be estimated from the full VIS-NIR spectroscopy include for instance carbon, nitrogen and particle size distributions.</p>

<p>Details on the eDNA methods and links to the source data are found on the <a href="/in-situ_methods/spectroscopy/">spectroscopy</a> page.</p>

<h2 id="citizen-scientist-methods">Citizen scientist methods</h2>

<p>The citizen scientist methods range from advanced enzymatic analysis using spectroscopy and image analysis to a free app for determining soil aggregate stability. The common denominator for the citizen science methods is that samples need to brought home, prepared and then analysed. But the whole process can be performed in for example a kitchen.</p>

<h3 id="soil-enzymatic-activity-reader-sear">Soil Enzymatic Activity Reader (SEAR)</h3>

<p>SEAR is a method developed by the Swiss startup <a href="/in-situ_methods/digitsoil">DigitSoil</a>, a partner in the AI4SH project. In the SEAR method fresh soil is placed on a reaction plate with 25 cells prepared for identifying 5 different key soil metabolic enzymes. Using built-in spectral analysis, the activity rate for each enzyme is reported in under an hour.</p>

<p>Details on the eDNA methods and links to the source data are found on the <a href="/in-situ_methods/digitsoil">Digit Soil Enzymatic Activity</a> page.</p>

<h3 id="microbiometer">Microbiometer</h3>

<p><a href="https://microbiometer.com">Microbiometer</a> is a commercially available kit for analysing soil microorganism carbon content and the ration between bacteria:fungi. It requires a small soil sample (1 ml) and addition of a reactant that is stirred with the soil sample and then analysed using a reference plate and a smartphone app after 20 minutes. The results are presented immediately.</p>

<p>Details on Microbiometer method and links to the source data are found on the <a href="/in-situ_methods/microbiometer/">Microbiometer</a> page.</p>

<h3 id="aggregate-stability-slakesmoulder-apps">Aggregate stability (slakes/moulder apps)</h3>

<p>Aggregate stability - clumps of soil particles held together as a result of biological (i.e. enzymatic) activity is well known for having beneficial effects on soil health. <a href="https://soilhealthinstitute.org/our-work/initiatives/slakes/">The Soil Health Institute</a> and  developed the conceptual idea of soaking pie-sized dried soil aggregates in water and estimate stability from the disintegration of the soaked aggregate. University of Sydney developed this into a smartphone app that is freely applicable as a citizen scientist method for estimating soil aggregate stability. The app exists in 2 version, [Moulder][molder] and [Slakes][slakes]. The method was tested on subsets of samples for some of the pilot sites.</p>

<p>Details on the slakes/moulder app method and links to the source data are found on the <a href="/in-situ_methods/aggregates/">aggregate stability</a> page.</p>

<h3 id="citizen-scientist-spectroscopy">Citizen scientist spectroscopy</h3>

<p>Spectral instrument that can be used either directly in the field or in a home environment have developed rapidly over the past decade. The commercially available, better range of these instruments are suitable for soil spectroscopy. Ideally, the soil should be dried and sieved before analysis. This eliminates the nonlinear influence of water, and also the soil spectral reference libraries used for estimating soil attributes from the spectra typically are based on dried and sieved samples. Within AI4SH the handheld Neospectra scanner developed by <a href="https://www.si-ware.com">SI-ware</a>, sold to <a href="https://www.walderwyss.com/en/news/2025-05-19_buchi-acquires-neospectra-platform-from-si-ware-systems">Buchi</a> in 2025 and rebranded <a href="https://www.buchi.com/en/products/instruments/proxiscout">ProxiScout</a> was applied in a majority of the pilot sites. Most samples were analysed both in fresh, wet conditions, and all after drying and sieving.</p>

<p>Details on the NeoSpectra/ProxiScout spectral method and links to the source data are found on the <a href="/in-situ_methods/spectroscopy/">spectroscopy</a> page.</p>

<h3 id="bulk-density-and-soil-moisture-content">Bulk density and soil moisture content</h3>

<p>Soil compaction is one of the most serious threats to soil health. Many attempts have been made to quickly estimate bulk density, a proxy for soil compaction, in the field. Hitherto, to our knowledge, no successful direct field method has been presented. Instead a soil cylinder, with a very precise volume, is hammered into the soil with both ends open, then shaved at the openings and dried at 105<sup>o</sup> C and the net weight divided by the volume then represents the bulk density. By measuring the weight loss over the drying the method also produces an estimate of soil water content. The method was applied at all AI4SH sampling points.</p>

<p>Details on the soil cylinder method and links to the source data are found on the <a href="/in-situ_methods/bulkdensity/">bulk density and soil moisture content</a> page.</p>

<h3 id="ion-selective-electrode-ise">Ion Selective Electrode (ISE)</h3>

<p>Ion selective electrodes are precision instruments used in laboratories. They measure the electrical potential over a membrane with a reference liquid on one side (the probe inside) and a (usually liquid) sample on the other. ISEs exist for most ions but pH ISEs are the most widely used. pH ISEs are both low-cost and reliable. In the AI4SH project two kinds of pH ISEs were tested, one for direct soil analysis in the field, and one laboratory ISE analysis after dissolving the soil in distilled water at a ratio 1:5.</p>

<p>Details on the pH Ion Selective Electrode method and links to the source data are found on the <a href="/in-situ_methods/ise/">pH ISE</a> page.</p>

<h3 id="electrical-conductivity">Electrical conductivity</h3>

<p>Electrical conductivity (EC) is an indication of salinity. Salinity is recognised as one of the major drivers of soil deterioration and a key soil health indicator identified for Europe. EC instruments based on the same technology as ISEs are available on the market, but where not tested. Instead the AI4SH in-situ studies included a simpler bi-pin electronic device measuring the resistance in a soil:water solution of 1:5. The tests where performed on soil brought to an indoor environment but using wet soils without prior drying.</p>

<p>Details on the bi-pin electrical conductivity method and links to the source data are found on the <a href="/in-situ_methods/salinity/">bi-pin salinity</a> page.</p>

<h2 id="direct-layperson-methods">Direct layperson methods</h2>

<p>A plethora of different layperson methods for estimating soil health does exists, including burying pure cotton knickers over a prolonged period; the spade test for sensory examination of wetness, colour, odour, structure, and texture; or measuring the diurnal temperature cycle. In AI4SH the selection of direct layperson methods was restricted to methods that can be applied instantly and that generate a signal without requiring human interpretation of the raw data.</p>

<h3 id="layperson-spectroscopy">Layperson spectroscopy</h3>

<p>Miniaturisation and technical developments have led to several manufacturers of optical spectra sensors to develop sensors that can be combined with microcontrollers. As part of AI4SH we tested two sensors from [Hamamatsu][hamamatsu] built into a casing about the size of a deck of cards and operated either via a computer or a bluetooth and a smartphone. The two selected sensors covers a limited spectral range in the VIS and short NIR regions. These instruments were tested at a subset of the pilot sites, in most cases scanning both wet and dried as well as sieved samples. The layperson spectroemters tested in AI4SH were built by the Swedish startup <a href="https://xspectre.com">Xspectre</a>.</p>

<p>Details on the Xspectre spectral method and links to the source data are found on the <a href="/in-situ_methods/spectroscopy/">spectroscopy</a> page.</p>

<h3 id="penetrometer">Penetrometer</h3>

<p>A penetrometer is an instrument with 1 or more spikes of typically 5 to 10 cm length that is pushed into the soil directly in the field. Traditional penetrometers are analogue instruments used for evaluaing soil compaction, but more recent developments have led to small digital penetrometers that can observe a range os soil properties. Connected to a microcontroller and with a power supply of 5 V or more, these instruments can estimate soil moisture, electrical conductivity, salinity, ph and key nutrients. Laboratory tests show that they are capable of giving consistent, but sometimes biased, signals. Especially for moisture and electrical conductivity/salinity. Penetrometers were applied at a subset of the pilot sites. In AI4SH we tested a 5-pin penetrometer built with an interface developed by the Swedish startup <a href="https://xspectre.com">Xspectre</a>.</p>

<p>Details on the Xspectre penetroemter method and links to the source data are found on the <a href="/in-situ_methods/penetrometer/">penetrometer</a> page.</p>

<h3 id="infiltration-and-soil-hydraulic-properties">Infiltration and soil hydraulic properties</h3>

<p>Soil infiltration capacity and other hydraulic properties including water holding capacity, are important properties that relate to flood, drought and erosion risks. A simple method for estimating these hydraulic properties is to insert a small (5-10 cm) cylinder with both ends open a few centimetres into the soil and then repeatedly pour a small fixed volume of water into the cylinder. From the time it takes for the soil to swallow the water, and its change with each sequential fill, the hydraulic properties can be estimated. A prerequisite is that the bulk density and initial and final soil moisture are known. These prerequisites, however, can be obtained with the above listed <a href="/in-situ_methods/penetrometer/">penetrometer</a> instrument and a bulk density cylinder.</p>

<p>The single ring infiltration test was performed at a subset of the pilot site. Details on the infiltration method and links to the source data are found on the <a href="/in-situ_methods/infiltration">infiltration</a> page.</p>
